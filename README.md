Overview

	- The purpose of this assignment was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that is searchable by date, city, state, country, and the shape of the reported UFO. These additional factors will be used to more efficiently search for different instances of UFO sightings, or will enable researchers to find potential hot spots of UFO activity.

Results

	- Someone will first select a filter to find a desired date, then will proceed to narrow down their search by choosing which country to search in, followed by the state, and particular city in which she is looking for information. 

Summary
	
	- One potential drawback of this webpage is that it does not address the types of UFO encounters (Seen by pilot, number of witnesses, etc.). 
	- Two additional recommendations for further development:
		1. Add an option for who reported to UFO
			a) Military vs. civilian
		2. Add an option for number of witnesses.
